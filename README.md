# Framebuffer Graphics
**This is a modified version of a really old project I build back in high school. I'm still in progress of making it more modern and fast, and at the moment, it compiles, but is most likely very buggy**

At it's heart, this project aims to allow programs running on a small device such as a raspberry pi to be able to draw graphics using a simple API and without needing the X window system.

## Dependencies
Install `libpng-dev` and `libjpeg-dev` if you are using the PNG or JPEG functions.
```bash
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev libjpeg-dev
```

## Building the demo
```bash
make
```
